# Geonode-Scrape
[GeoNode](https://geonode.com) is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS)<br>
and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).<br>
It is designed to be extended and modified, and can be integrated into existing platforms.<br>
It also offers [free proxies](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list) and you can choose the parameters too unlike other free proxy sites.<br>

## [GeoNode](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list) **has** a feature to import proxies *but* with other information which is **not usually needed** at most of the times.<br>

### The objective of this repository is to import proxies from [GeoNode](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list) but only the information which is needed.<br>
